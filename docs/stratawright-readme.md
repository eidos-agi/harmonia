## Overview

You opened your DAW to create music—not to burn half your brain on shortcuts, modifier keys, and complex control interfaces. **Let tools serve your creativity, not your memory.**

**Stratawright** is an agentic DAW that your AI agent can natively control so you can focus purely on making music. Instead of spending 30 minutes manually levelling tracks for streaming, removing background noise from recordings, or routing effect plugins across every track, just tell your AI agent (**Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, **Hermes**, or **Gemini**) what you want in plain English. Your session gets prepped, balanced, and ready for production in seconds.

---

## Why an Agentic DAW?

Traditional DAWs were built for a keyboard-and-mouse era where every single operation required manual labor. As sessions grow to 100+ tracks, your creative energy gets drained by repetitive mechanical tasks.

| Traditional DAW Workflow | Stratawright Agentic Workflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hundreds of Clicks & Manual Edits**: Manually selecting, gain-staging, color-coding, and routing 100 tracks one-by-one. | **One Single Command**: A single natural language prompt controls 100+ tracks deterministically in a split second. |
| **The Shortcut Tax**: Searching online for forgotten keyboard shortcuts and complex modifier keys. | **Natural Language**: Just tell your AI agent what you want in plain English. |
| **Dumb Track Labels**: DAWs treat track names as plain text strings, forcing you to manually group and bus them. | **Semantic Intelligence**: AI agents understand instrument context (`GTR_L_57` → Guitar Bus) and group stems automatically. |
| **Creative Interruption**: Stopping your flow state to handle technical preferences, gain staging, and file prep. | **Pure Creative Flow**: The AI agent works in the background as your tireless studio assistant. |

---

## Quick Start & Agentic Setup

No terminal commands or manual compilation required. Open your AI agent (**Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, **Hermes**, **Gemini CLI**, **OpenCode**, and 50+ more) and tell it to handle the setup:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goldwaterfung/Stratawright.git
cd Stratawright
```

Or tell your AI agent:

```text
Clone https://github.com/Goldwaterfung/Stratawright and set up the project for me
```

### 2. Build & Setup Stratawright (Agent compiles the app)
Tell your agent:

```text
Build and package Stratawright for me
```

*(Your agent will automatically run `./scripts/install_dependencies.sh` and `./scripts/build.sh release --package` under the hood).*

### 3. Install the Skill (Teaches your agent how to control DAW)

Install directly via **[skills.sh](https://skills.sh)** (Vercel Agent Skills Registry):

```bash
npx skills add ./skills/daw-cli
```

Or tell your AI agent in chat:

```text
Install the daw-cli skill from https://github.com/Goldwaterfung/Stratawright
```

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2: Manual Skill Directory Setup</b></summary>
<br>

To manually install the skill into your preferred AI agent framework, copy or symlink the `skills/daw-cli/` directory:

| Agent Framework | Local Workspace Skill Path | Global User Skill Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Codex** | `.agents/skills/daw-cli` | `~/.agents/skills/daw-cli` |
| **Claude Code / Co-Work** | `.claude/skills/daw-cli` | `~/.claude/skills/daw-cli` |
| **Hermes** | `.hermes/skills/daw-cli` | `~/.hermes/skills/daw-cli` |
| **Antigravity** | `.agents/skills/daw-cli` | `~/.gemini/config/skills/daw-cli` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `.gemini/skills/daw-cli` | `~/.gemini/skills/daw-cli` |
| **OpenCode** | `.opencode/skills/daw-cli` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/daw-cli` |

Once installed, your agent uses [`skills/daw-cli/SKILL.md`](skills/daw-cli/SKILL.md) as its operational manual.
